# Visual-Lifelog-Retrieval-through-Captioning-Enhanced-Interpretation

## Data Description
This repository contains detailed image captions generated by various advanced AI models. The dataset is based on the NTCIR-14 Lifelog-3 lifelog image dataset and provides rich, descriptive captions for each image. Each image is represented with multiple captioning outputs and a structured breakdown of interpretations.

## Data Structure
The dataset is organized as a dictionary where the keys represent image file paths, and the values are JSON objects containing multiple captioning outputs and contextual summaries. Each entry includes:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the image.
- **Idefics2**: Caption generated by the Idefics2 model based on single caption method.
- **LLaVA-Next**: Caption generated by the LLaVA-Next-7B model based on single caption method.
- **Internlm-xcomposer2**: Caption generated by the Internlm-xcomposer2-7B model based on single caption method.
- **Video-LLaVA**: Caption generated by the Video-LLaVA model based on collective caption method.
- **Large-World-Model**: Caption generated by the Large-World-Model based on collective caption method.
- **GPT4-0613**:Caption generaged by GPT4-vision-turbo-0613 based on merged caption method.
  - **fine-grained**: Fine-grained caption generated by GPT4-turbo-vision based on merged method.
  - **coarse-grained**: Coarse-grained caption generated by GPT4-turbo-vision based on merged method.
  - **Experience-summary**: Summary of the experience depicted in the images generated by GPT4-turbo-vision based on merged method.

    "Idefics2": "A person is holding a keyboard and water bottle.",
    "LLaVA-Next": "The image captures a moment of quiet solitude, as a person sits in a room, engrossed in the digital world. The individual, clad in a vibrant red sweater, is holding a smartphone in their hands, their fingers dancing over the screen. The phone is connected to a laptop, suggesting a work or study session in progress.\n\nThe room around them is a testament to their lifestyle, with a desk and a chair visible in the background.
